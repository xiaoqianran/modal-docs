# Workspace

```python
class Workspace(modal.object.Object)
```

## hydrate

```python
hydrate(self, client=None)
```

Synchronize the local object with its identity on the Modal server.

It is rarely necessary to call this method explicitly, as most operations
will lazily hydrate when needed. The main use case is when you need to
access object metadata, such as its ID.

*Added in v0.72.39*: This method replaces the deprecated `.resolve()` method.

## name

```python
name(self)
```

## members

```python
members: WorkspaceMembersManager
```

Namespace with methods for managing the membership of a Workspace.

### members.list

```python
list(self)
```

Return the members of the Workspace.

**Examples:**

```python notest
members = modal.Workspace.from_context().members.list()
print([m.name for m in members])
```

## from\_context

```python
from_context(*, client=None)
```

Look up the Workspace associated with the current context.

This returns the Workspace that the active Modal credentials authenticate against
(i.e., your active profile or the `MODAL_TOKEN_ID` / `MODAL_TOKEN_SECRET` environment
variables). If called inside a Modal container, it returns the Workspace that the
container is running in.

## billing

```python
billing: WorkspaceBillingManager
```

Namespace for Workspace billing APIs.

### billing.report

```python
report(self, *, start, end=None, resolution="d", tag_names=None)
```

Return a cost report for all Workspace usage, broken down by object and time.

**Parameters**

<Parameter name="start" type="datetime" description="Start of the report, inclusive and rounded to the beginning of the interval. Must be in UTC or timezone-naive (interpreted as UTC)." />
<Parameter name="end" type="datetime | None" defaultValue="None" description="End of the report, exclusive. Must be in UTC or timezone-naive. Partial final intervals will be excluded from the report." />
<Parameter name="resolution" type="str" defaultValue="&quot;d&quot;" description="Resolution, e.g. &quot;d&quot; for daily or &quot;h&quot; for hourly." />
<Parameter name="tag_names" type="list[str] | None" defaultValue="None" description="List of tag names; each row will include the tag name and value in use for that object during the relevant time interval. Pass `[&quot;*&quot;]` to include all tags in the report." />

**Returns**

A list of `BillingReportItem` dataclasses. Each item reports the cost attributed to
a specific Modal object during a given time interval. Cost is further broken down by
the resource type that generated it (e.g. CPU, Memory, specific GPU usage). Note that
the specific resource types included in the breakdown are subject to change as Modal's
billing model evolves.

  A workspace report CLI that has convenience features around relative time range queries
  and JSON/CSV output.
* [`Environment.billing.report()`](https://modal.com/docs/sdk/py/latest/Environment#billingreport):
  An analogous report API that is scoped to a specific Environment.

### billing.summary

```python
summary(self, cycle=None)
```

Return a summary of workspace cost over a single billing cycle determined by `cycle`

**Parameters**

<Parameter name="cycle" type="str | datetime | None" defaultValue="None" description="Start of the summary, inclusive. Must be the first of a month, and must be in UTC or timezone-naive (interpreted as UTC). If provided as a string, it must either be formatted as an ISO 8601 month (YYYY-MM), or must be one of the convenience spellings &quot;this month&quot; or &quot;last month&quot;. If not provided, `cycle` defaults to the first of the current month (in which case a summary is generated for the current billing cycle)." />

**Returns**

A single `WorkspaceBillingSummary` dataclass containing the following fields:

* `metered_cost` representing cost before any adjustments,
* `billed_cost` representing the cost actually invoiced, including all adjustments,
* `adjustments` containing a breakdown of the adjustments that make up the difference
  between `metered_cost` and `billed_cost`. This can include discounts for free volume
  storage, adjustments due to plan credits, etc. The exact keys of this are subject to
  change as Modal's billing model evolves.
* `metered_cost_breakdown` containing a breakdown of that cost by the Modal resources
  that generated it. The exact keys of this are subject to change as Modal's billing
  model evolves.

All values are reported as `decimal.Decimal`s.

## proxy\_tokens

```python
proxy_tokens: WorkspaceProxyTokenManager
```

Namespace with methods for managing the proxy tokens in a Workspace.

See [the guide](https://modal.com/docs/guide/webhook-proxy-auth) for more information on proxy tokens.

### proxy\_tokens.create

```python
create(self)
```

Create a new proxy token for the Workspace.

**Usage**

```python notest
token = modal.Workspace.from_context().proxy_tokens.create()
print(token.token_id, token.token_secret)
```

### proxy\_tokens.list

```python
list(self, environment_name=None)
```

List proxy tokens in the Workspace.

**Parameters**

<Parameter name="environment_name" type="Optional[str]" defaultValue="None" description="When provided, list only the tokens associated with this environment." />

**Usage**

```python notest
ws = modal.Workspace.from_context()

# List all proxy tokens in the Workspace
tokens = ws.proxy_tokens.list()
print([t.token_id for t in tokens])

# List only the proxy tokens associated with a specific Environment
env_tokens = ws.proxy_tokens.list(environment_name="prod")
```

### proxy\_tokens.allow

```python
allow(self, proxy_token_id, environment_name)
```

Allow a proxy token to authenticate requests to a given Environment.

**Parameters**

<Parameter name="proxy_token_id" type="str" description="The token ID (`wk-...`) to operate on." />
<Parameter name="environment_name" type="str" description="The name of the environment to allow access to." />

```

### proxy\_tokens.revoke

```python
revoke(self, proxy_token_id, environment_name)
