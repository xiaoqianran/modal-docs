# `modal run`

Run a Modal function or local entrypoint.

`FUNC_REF` should be of the format `{file or module}::{function name}`.
Alternatively, you can refer to the function via the app:

`{file or module}::{app variable name}.{function name}`

Examples:

To run the hello\_world function (or local entrypoint) in my\_app.py:

```
modal run my_app.py::hello_world
```

If your module only has a single app and your app has a
single local entrypoint (or single function), you can omit the app and
function parts:

```
modal run my_app.py
```

Instead of pointing to a file, you can also use the Python module path, which
by default will ensure that your remote functions will use the same module
names as they do locally.

```
modal run -m my_project.my_app
```

**Usage**:

```shell
modal run [OPTIONS] FUNC_REF
```

**Options**:

* `-n, --name TEXT`: Name for this run of the App.
* `-w, --write-result TEXT`: Write return value (which must be str or bytes) to this local path.
* `-q, --quiet`: Don't show Modal progress indicators.
* `-d, --detach`: Don't stop the app if the local process dies or disconnects.
* `-i, --interactive`: Run the app in interactive mode.
* `-e, --env TEXT`: Environment to interact with. If unspecified, defers to `MODAL_ENVIRONMENT`, your active local profile, or your workspace default, in that order.
* `-m`: Interpret argument as a Python module path instead of a file/script path
* `--timestamps`: Show timestamps for each log line.
* `--help`: Show this message and exit.
