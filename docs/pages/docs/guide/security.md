# Security and privacy at Modal

This page outlines Modal's security and privacy commitments.

Our [Trust Center](https://trust.modal.com/) provides [compliance](#compliance-standards) documentation, including our SOC 2 Type II report, our list of subprocessors, and details of our security controls.

## Information security program

Our information security (InfoSec) program covers three practice areas: application security, corporate security, and network and infrastructure security.

<Collapsible title="Application security (AppSec)">

AppSec covers how we build, test, review, and deploy the Modal platform.

* We build our software using memory-safe programming languages, including Rust (for our worker runtime and storage infrastructure) and Python (for our API servers and Modal client).
* Software dependencies are automatically audited for known vulnerabilities.
* We make decisions that minimize our attack surface. Most interactions with Modal are well-described in a gRPC API, and occur through [`modal`](https://pypi.org/project/modal), our open-source command-line tool and Python client library.
* We have automated synthetic monitoring test applications that continuously check for network and application isolation within our runtime.
* We force HTTPS (TLS) for all services, including our public website and the Dashboard. Our [client library](https://pypi.org/project/modal) connects to Modal's servers over TLS and verifies TLS certificates on each connection.
* Your data is encrypted in transit and at rest.
* All public Modal APIs use [TLS 1.3](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc8446).
* Internal code reviews are performed using a PR-based development workflow, and we engage external penetration testing firms to assess our software security.

</Collapsible>

<Collapsible title="Corporate security (CorpSec)">

CorpSec covers how our employees access internal systems.

* Access to internal systems requires single sign-on (SSO) through our identity provider.
* Phishing-resistant multi-factor authentication (MFA) is required for all employee accounts.
* We regularly audit access to internal systems.
* Employee laptops are enrolled in mobile device management (MDM) with full disk encryption enforced.

</Collapsible>

<Collapsible title="Network and infrastructure security (InfraSec)">

InfraSec covers how we secure the infrastructure that runs your workloads.

* We continuously monitor platform logs and metrics through third-party observability providers.
* Each container runs in its own sandbox, isolated from the host, using primitives like [gVisor](https://github.com/google/gvisor) or microVMs.
* We run business continuity and security incident exercises every year.

</Collapsible>

### Vulnerability remediation

We remediate vulnerabilities in Modal's systems within the timeframes below, measured from when a fix becomes available. Severity is based on the CVSS rating of the vulnerability and our assessment of its impact on Modal.

#### Severity timeframes

* **Critical:** 24 hours
* **High:** 1 week
* **Medium:** 1 month
* **Low:** 3 months
* **Informational:** 3 months or longer

### Bug bounty program

We welcome responsible disclosure from the security community and run a private bug bounty program through HackerOne. To participate, email <security@modal.com> with your HackerOne username and we will send an invite. When performing security research, you must use a Modal Workspace whose name ends in `-H1-<username>`, where `<username>` is your HackerOne username.

## Data privacy

This section covers how long each type of data is kept, which products retain no data at all, and where your data is stored.

### Data retention

Retention varies by product; the table below shows how long each type of data is retained. All stored data is encrypted at rest.

### Zero data retention

[Dedicated](/docs/guide/dedicated-endpoints) and [Shared](/docs/guide/shared-endpoints) inference endpoints have zero data retention. Request and response payloads are never written to disk and pass through Modal only as in-flight network traffic.

### Data residency

See our [data residency guide](/docs/guide/data-residency) for where each type of data is stored and the controls available for residency requirements.

## Shared responsibility model

Modal prioritizes the integrity, security, and availability of customer data. Under our shared responsibility model, you also have responsibilities in the areas below.
