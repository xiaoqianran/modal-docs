# Shared Endpoints

Shared Endpoints serve a subset of models in the
[Modal Library](https://modal.com/library) from Modal-managed pools. Every model
available for Shared Endpoints is also available for
[Dedicated Endpoints](/docs/guide/dedicated-endpoints). The Library shows which
serving modes each model supports. Modal manages the hardware and autoscaling,
and usage is billed per token.

## Create a Shared Endpoint

Create a Shared Endpoint from the
[**Endpoints**](https://modal.com/endpoints) tab in the dashboard.

Once the Endpoint is ready, the dashboard provides its URL, model name, and
request examples. Shared Endpoints always require a
[proxy token](/docs/guide/endpoints#proxy-tokens).

## Concurrency limits

Shared Endpoints have model-specific limits on concurrent in-flight requests.
The limit is shared across all Shared Endpoints using the same model in your
Workspace. Requests above the limit receive an HTTP `429` response; retry them
with exponential backoff and jitter.

Use a [Dedicated Endpoint](/docs/guide/dedicated-endpoints) when you need
isolated or configurable capacity.

## Pricing

Token rates are shown when you create an Endpoint and in its Usage view. Credits
included with your plan cannot be used for Shared Endpoint usage. To cap
out-of-pocket charges, see [spend limits](/docs/guide/budgets#spend-limits).

Shared Endpoint requests route through `us-west` and always require
authentication. Modal manages their infrastructure and capacity.
